openFrameworks 007 port of Kevin Atkinson's Fast Image Cloning Library (Thanks Kevin!)

http://methodart.blogspot.com/2011/07/fast-image-cloning-library-ive-written.html

Kevin's original project is QT based and 64bit so I have included the 32bit versions of the necessary libraries so it can work with OF.
This was a fairly long process so if the project doesn't at least compile let me know.

CURRENT STATE:
Loads Image
You can draw a selection with the mouse - press Return to set selection
Mesh appears

The OpenGL implementation is a bit beyond my experience so any insights or help with the FastLaplaceComper::Render function would be appreciated!
